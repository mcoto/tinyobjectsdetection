# Small Object Detection in Images

## Project Overview
This repository hosts an ongoing research initiative focused on **detecting and quantifying small objects in images** through **machine learning** and **advanced image processing** techniques.  
The work aims to develop, evaluate, and refine algorithms capable of robust detection under real-world conditions, with particular emphasis on cases where object size, contrast, and occlusion present significant challenges.

The repository is designed as a **collaborative research space**. Contributors—researchers, engineers, and collaborators—are encouraged to propose, implement, and evaluate new approaches that enhance detection accuracy, speed, and robustness.

## Research Goals
- Advance the state of the art in **small object detection**.
- Evaluate and compare multiple **deep learning architectures** for this problem.
- Establish a reproducible benchmarking framework for performance evaluation.
- Build a repository of detection experiments, datasets, and analysis tools.
